### Components

* Basic building blocks in React.
* Components have:
  * State: State stores the attributes associated with the Component. States can be changed.

  * Props (aka Properties): They are inherited by Component from parent component. They are immutable.

  * LifeCycle: Every component has a LifeCycle, which contains stages like
    1. Component will mount.
    2. Component did mount.
    3. Component recieved Properties.
    4. Component was removed.
