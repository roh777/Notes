### React

React JS is a view library to design interfaces. It's opensource and is developed by facebook.

* It's not a complete MVC framework like AngularJS. It's only view part.
* Uses JSX syntax (a combination of javascript).

** Pros **

- It uses a **virtual DOM** representation of actual webpage in JS. It is used by React to optimally change the actual DOM, instead of completely refreshing it.

- Components - are at the heart of React. They represent a subsection of webpage/inteface.
